# SQL - More queries

** When people talk about databases, they’re usually referring to relational databases (such as PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle, …); but there are many other kinds of databases used in the industry, which are globally referred to as “NoSQL” databases, even though they can be very different from each other, and serve very various purposes. Also, the name “NoSQL” comes from SQL, which is the name of the syntax used to give orders (CRUD operations, creating and deleting tables, …) to a relational databases; however, some non-relational databases, which are referred to as “NoSQL” give the option to use the SQL syntax. Therefore, the term “NoSQL” is quite controversial to refer to non-relational databases, but it is still widely used.

*** “NoSQL” (non-relational) databases have known a boost in popularity, over the last decade or so, so much that there was a point, a few years ago, where people were wondering if they were to replace relational databases entirely. But years later, the market has now solidified, NoSQL databases’ market share doesn’t progress much anymore and is now quite steady. The result: many NoSQL databases have made it into solid maturity, and are used in some very ambitious projects (as well as small ones), but relational databases are still by far the most used in projects, and are not going anywhere after all.

** Therefore: it is crucial for a software engineer to know very well how relational databases work, because the odds are very strong that you will encounter them in your career; but it is also very important to get acquainted with the most popular types of NoSQL databases, because the odds that you run into them, however kinda smaller, are pretty strong too.
